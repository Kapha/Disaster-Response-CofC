# Disaster Relief CoC: With Event manager
This is a possible application to manage volunteers and resources for the [*Churches of Christ Disaster Relief*](https://www.facebook.com/disasterreliefeffort)
This was origianally envisioned after the Joplin F5 Tornado and hopes to not only
streamline the creation of new events but also allow for sharing of data between
multiple locations within the same event.
